# Hi, I'm Jacob Rieker

I'm a self-taught software developer and Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, currently based in the Greater Houston area. I specialize in **backend development** and **game development**, with a business mindset and a passion for building things that people actually use.

My work blends structure and creativity — from designing scalable backend systems to developing fast-paced, competitive multiplayer games with loyal player bases. I’ve run online leagues, led communities, shipped production-ready features, and built games and apps that generate real engagement and income.
